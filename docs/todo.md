### Example Features
    Upload or stream waveform data → classify for tremor/foreshock patterns
    Analyze historical earthquake sequences using sliding time windows
    Display risk heatmaps for a region over time
    Input InSAR image → detect ground deformation using Hugging Face models
    Auto-generate a daily seismic summary for a region

* Visual dashboard with risk indicators and animated seismic maps
* Side-by-side comparison of predicted vs. actual earthquake events
* Optional email/SMS alerts (via Twilio) for risk threshold exceedance

### Optional Enhancements
    Use streaming data from Raspberry Shake sensors
    Integrate InSAR deformation data from Copernicus/Sentinel-1
    Use GNN (Graph Neural Networks) for stress transfer modeling
    Add Slack/Telegram notifications for high-risk detections
