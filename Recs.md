Designed a real-time risk scoring dashboard with waveform anomaly detection and automated event summarization, enabling focused early warning insights for geoscience and emergency management use.

üåç Project Name: QuakeCast ‚Äì AI-Powered Earthquake Pattern Detection & Early Risk Forecasting

üöÄ What It Does
QuakeCast is an AI-powered platform that analyzes seismic data, satellite imagery, and historical patterns to detect potential foreshocks, anomalies, and stress signatures‚Äîand predict short-term earthquake risks in tectonically active regions.
It does not predict exact earthquakes (no AI can currently), but provides real-time anomaly detection and risk-level indicators to help scientists, civil authorities, and planners monitor early warning signals and allocate attention to high-risk zones. 
üåê Real-World Problem It Solves
Earthquake prediction remains one of the grand challenges in geoscience. While precise forecasting is not yet possible, early detection of precursor anomalies (like low-frequency tremor, gas emissions, or stress migration) using machine learning can help inform early alerts and focused monitoring, potentially saving lives and resources.
ü§ñ Key Hugging Face Tasks Used
